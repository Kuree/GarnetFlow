1905 STATUS
- project on hold for now, waiting for feedback from priyanka and pat


1905 TODO
- automate the tests
-- hourly cron job
-- need ssh key for password-less login
- clean up below
- checkmarks for pass/fail?
- still don't have power domain, soc tests
- lassen tests should come from *buildkite*, not lassen I guess, see below


buildkite link (can be reached via link/badge in lassen README):

  export PATH=.:/home/steveri/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin

  # INSTALL PROBLEMS
  # Weird "main not found" error when trying to run pip3, solve by doing this:
  sudo python3 -m pip uninstall pip && sudo apt install python3-pip --reinstall

# Here are some of the locations of unit tests:

# - garnet/tests - This has top level, global buffer, global controller,
#   and interconnect test. For memory, this has the old tests, the new
#   tests are in memory_core_impl branch which will be hopefully merged soon.
# 
# - lassen/tests - This has the PE tests. I am not sure if lassen tests
#   are run again in garnet once the PE is instantiated.
# 
# - Ankita is integrating the power domain tests, she would know where
#   they are.
# 
# - James has SoC tests in the repo on the arm/tsmc machine. It might be
#   okay to extract the test log for the dashboard.
